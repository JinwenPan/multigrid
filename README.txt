Save all the files in one directory and call 'make'

The TARGET file is called 'mgsolve', so run the program like this:
./mgsolve 7 20
In the above example, 7 is the number of levels and 20 is the number of v-cycle iterations.

To activate the bonous task (Neumann on vertical edges), give an arbitrary 3rd argument like this:
./mgsolve 7 130 n
